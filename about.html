        <h1 class="text-center about-title">I retired at 40!</h1>
        <p>I graduated from the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University in May of 2002 and passed the July 2002 Texas Bar Exam. After returning home to Fresno in November 2002, I passed the February 2003 California Bar Exam and began working for a local firm on March 17, 2003. 
        <p>After 5 ½ years I was made a partner. Champagne bottles popped and cheers from my family, colleagues and friends were made. Starting January 1, 2009, all would be right in my professional world. Or so I thought. Making partner in such a short amount of time is a great accomplishment, that one should never diminish, but, it is not always what it has been built up to be. You finally see behind the curtain and, well, some things back there are not very pretty, and a few are downright frightening. Needless to say, I soon decided that I would make it my mission to retire early, I was not going to be practicing law until I was 65, or even 55 for that matter.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I had taken some steps to help me towards that goal. I had been maxing out my 401(k) every year, bought a lovely but reasonable home before the unreasonable bubble prices went into play, and a certified pre-owned luxury car in my desired price range that I still drive today. Now don’t get me wrong, I liked, and still like, nice things. And I could spend money with the best of them, but I always paid my bills early, like my parents taught me, and paid myself first by putting money away each pay period and made some good investments. Also, I took extremely good care of my things. My clothes, shoes, and bags probably cost more than most, but they have also lasted longer. I treated them as investment pieces. And fun fact, my bags are worth more today than when I bought them. But I will never part with them. LOL. </p> 
        <p>After 14 years of practicing commercial and employment litigation, with 4 years of special education law mixed in, I decided it was time to put my health and happiness first and retire. I was able to do this thanks to decisions I made as soon as I started working and my extremely supportive family. I have not looked back, because I am not going that way. The future is in front of me and I wake up excited to see what each day has in store for me.</p>
